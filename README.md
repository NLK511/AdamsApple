# TradeDesk Advisor (SvelteKit)

A clean and professional SvelteKit trading advisor UI that lets you:

- Create and switch between multiple ticker watchlists.
- Track current prices with daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly/yearly change snapshots.
- Set threshold alerts for each ticker when price moves above or below a value.
- Persist watchlist state in local storage.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the local URL shown by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).
